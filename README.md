# GroupMeBot created by Jacob Madian
This program was created to automate the process of allocating leftover food in a house of 40 people

In the past, requests for leftover food have been made by writing your name on a whiteboard located in the kitchen

As people forget to sign up before they leave, a large amount of people consistently ask for somebody to write their name on the board

This code uses a GroupMe chat to automate this feature and display active lists for lunch and dinner requests

A raspberry pi is consistently running this code in the kitchen attached to a monitor for visual access, and resets all request lists at a specified time
